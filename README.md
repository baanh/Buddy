# Buddy - Always on track of your time

We are developing an app that help users plan their work, study, and other things in life effectively. Our ambition is to track every hours spent by the user with detail about what they do, whom they meet, and schedule conflicts if any. We are also working on algorithms to check and recommend shifting schedule conflicts appropriately to give our users the best productivity.
